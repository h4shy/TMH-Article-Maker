# TMH-Article-Maker
AI-based article maker with webhook for discord
This simple app can save you many minutes trying to create nice articles for your discord server
1. Write messy unorganized information
2. click on Generate button
3. copy or send your new AI improved article

[Download for windows](https://github.com/h4shy/TMH-Article-Maker/releases/download/v1.0.1/TMH.Article.Maker.zip)
Note: its a small app with zero error handling, it will keep prompting you for correct input if you made an error (kinda annoying)
also don't modify the txt files manually or it might crash, will crash too if given invalid tokens
