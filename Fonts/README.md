I forgot to bake the fonts in the app lol, anyway this is useless you don't need it, it only makes the app title nicer to look at

[Download magneto](https://www.wfonts.com/font/magneto) if you don't already have it.

[Download bauhaus-93](https://www.wfonts.com/font/bauhaus-93) if you don't already have it.

quick note: I'm not affiliated with wfonts.com or the manufacturer of the fonts, so these fonts and any other fonts are not included with the app licencing 
it means (do your research before using them commercially). but you should be fine using them on your device
